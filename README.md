# Week 2 Challenge - Professional Portfolio

In this week's challenge I created a Professional Portfolio to showcase my skills and talents to potential employers. My portfolio highlights my strongest works and links the user to my deployed applications.

> **Note**: The download resume button is not currently functional. An updated version of the application will be pushed to the repo once my resume is added to the application.
